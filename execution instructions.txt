Instructions to execute the code:

The starting block of code is the input of goodies and their prices
followed by the execution part(output)

Once you run the code, 
it first asks for the number of employees to decide for the number of goodies

that is the only input we give

based on the number of employees, the code selects those many number of goodies
randomly from the available goodies.

Then the goodie with highest price and lowest price are found and 
difference of those two is obtained and displayed.
